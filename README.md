# My Home Assistant Configuration
This is my Home Assistant configuration at the current state. It is not nearly finished yet, but I am working constantly on it. Also I implemented just a few automation for now. However, one step after the other I plan to automate a lot of more scenes.

## Hardware
My Home Assistant configuration is running on a Raspberry Pi 3. In the current state it delivers enough peformance to run my Home Automation. But I am sure this will not be enough for all time. Therefore I try to configurate my HA platform to be variable. It is my target to be able to easily switch from my Raspberry Pi to a more powerful machine in the future.
To reach this target I try to run all software components in docker containers.
